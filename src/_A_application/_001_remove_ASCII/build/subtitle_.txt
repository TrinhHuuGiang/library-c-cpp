Hi, welcome back! Previously, we
discussed frameworks and controls in general. In this video,
you'll learn about specific frameworks and
controls that organizations can voluntarily use to minimize risks to their data
and to protect users. Let's get started! The CIA triad is a foundational model that helps inform how
organizations consider risk when setting up systems
and security policies. CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality means that
only authorized users can access specific
assets or data. For example, strict
access controls that define who should and should
not have access to data, must be put in place to ensure confidential data remains safe. Integrity means the data is correct, authentic,
and reliable. To maintain integrity, security professionals
can use a form of data protection like encryption to safeguard data from
being tampered with. Availability means data is accessible to those who are
authorized to access it. Let's define a term
that came up during our discussion of the CIA triad: asset. An asset is an item perceived as having
value to an organization. And value is determined by the cost associated with the
asset in question. For example, an application
that stores sensitive data, such as social security
numbers or bank accounts, is a valuable asset
to an organization. It carries more risk
and therefore requires tighter security
controls in comparison to a website that shares
publicly available news content. As you may remember, earlier in the course, we discussed frameworks
and controls in general. Now, we'll discuss a specific
framework developed by the U.S.-based National Institute of Standards
and Technology: the Cybersecurity
Framework, also referred to as the NIST CSF. The NIST Cybersecurity
Framework is a voluntary framework that
consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. It's important to become
familiar with this framework because security teams use it as a baseline to manage
short and long-term risk. Managing and mitigating
risks and protecting an organization's assets from threat actors are key goals
for security professionals. Understanding the
different motives a threat actor may have, alongside identifying
your organization's most valuable assets
is important. Some of the most
dangerous threat actors to consider are
disgruntled employees. They are the most dangerous
because they often have access to sensitive information and know where to find it. In order to reduce
this type of risk, security professionals would use the principle of availability, as well as organizational
guidelines based on frameworks to ensure staff members can only access the data they need to
perform their jobs. Threat actors originate
from all across the globe, and a diverse workforce
of security professionals helps organizations identify
attackers' intentions. A variety of perspectives
can assist organizations in understanding and mitigating the impact of
malicious activity. That concludes our
introduction to the CIA triad and
NIST CSF framework, which are used to
develop processes to secure organizations and
the people they serve. You may be asked in
an interview if you know about security
frameworks and principles. Or you may be asked to
explain how they're used to secure
organizational assets. In either case,
throughout this program, you'll have multiple
opportunities to learn more about them and apply what we've discussed
to real-world situations. Coming up, we'll discuss the ethics of security.
See you soon!
